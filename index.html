        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Here‚Äôs to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They‚Äôre not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify them or vilify them. About the only thing you can‚Äôt do is ignore them. Because they change things.
        </p>

        <p>
          My purpose is to unite the world through code to create a healthy planet, active communities and an equal playing field for all.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is your Life. Do what you love, and do it often. If you don‚Äôt like something, change it. If you don‚Äôt like your job, quit. If you don‚Äôt have enough time, stop watching TV. Life is about the people you meet, and the things that you create with them so go out and start creating. Life is short. Live your dream and share your passion.
